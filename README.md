# Lunar-Lander
Using Java, I created 15 rockets with a an arraylist of "genes". Each element of this arraylist
represented a single "gene" that coded for whether the rocket would boost or not at that time. From
this, the altitude, fuel, velocity, and acceleration could be tracked for each individual rocket.The
rockets that performed the best (had the lowest impact velocity), acted as the "parent" rockets for the
next generation.
